    <h1>Common Table Expressions (CTE) in SQL</h1>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Common Table Expression (CTE)</strong> is a temporary result set that can be referenced within a <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> statement. CTEs are typically used to simplify complex queries, break down queries into manageable parts, and improve the readability of SQL code. They are created using the <code>WITH</code> keyword and can be thought of as a temporary table that only exists during the execution of a single query.
      </p>
      <p>
        CTEs can help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve query readability.</li>
        <li>Enable recursion.</li>
        <li>Avoid repetitive code.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Types of CTEs</h2>
      <p>There are two main types of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Non-Recursive CTE</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Recursive CTE</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Non-Recursive CTE</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Non-Recursive CTE</strong> is a simple CTE that is used to store a result set for use within a single query. It is not recursive and does not refer to itself. It is primarily used to simplify complex queries or break down a query into more manageable pieces.
      </p>
      <h3>Syntax:</h3>
      <pre><code>
  WITH CTE_Name AS (
      SELECT column1, column2
      FROM table_name
      WHERE condition
  )
  SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;
      </code></pre>
  
      <h3>Use Case:</h3>
      <p>
        - <strong>Breaking down complex queries:</strong> Non-recursive CTEs can make it easier to break complex queries into simpler parts.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre><code>
  WITH RegionalSales AS (
      SELECT Region, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
      FROM Sales
      WHERE YEAR(SaleDate) = 2024
      GROUP BY Region
  )
  SELECT * FROM RegionalSales;
      </code></pre>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The <code>WITH</code> clause defines the CTE called <code>RegionalSales</code>, which calculates the total sales for each region in the year 2024. The <code>SELECT * FROM RegionalSales</code> query then uses the CTE to fetch the result.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Recursive CTE</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Recursive CTE</strong> is a CTE that references itself. It is used for hierarchical or recursive queries where the result depends on previous iterations of the CTE. A recursive CTE consists of two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anchor member:</strong> The first part of the CTE that provides the initial result set.</li>
        <li><strong>Recursive member:</strong> The part that references the CTE itself and continues iterating until a specified condition is met.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Syntax:</h3>
      <pre><code>
  WITH RECURSIVE CTE_Name AS (
      -- Anchor member
      SELECT column1, column2
      FROM table_name
      WHERE condition
      
      UNION ALL
      
      -- Recursive member
      SELECT column1, column2
      FROM table_name
      INNER JOIN CTE_Name ON table_name.column = CTE_Name.column
  )
  SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;
      </code></pre>
  
      <h3>Use Case:</h3>
      <p>
        - <strong>Hierarchical data:</strong> Recursive CTEs are often used for retrieving hierarchical data, such as organizational structures or bill-of-materials (BOM).
      </p>
  
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre><code >
  WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
      -- Anchor member: Top-level managers
      SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, ManagerID
      FROM Employees
      WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
      
      UNION ALL
      
      -- Recursive member: Subordinates
      SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, e.ManagerID
      FROM Employees e
      INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
  )
  SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
      </code></pre>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The anchor member selects employees with no manager (top-level managers). The recursive member selects employees whose <code>ManagerID</code> matches an <code>EmployeeID</code> from the previous level of the hierarchy. The recursion continues until all employees and their respective managers are retrieved.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are a powerful feature in SQL that allows you to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query. They make complex queries easier to read, manage, and debug. The two main types‚Äî<strong>Non-Recursive CTE</strong> and <strong>Recursive CTE</strong>‚Äîserve different purposes. Non-recursive CTEs are used to simplify complex queries, while recursive CTEs are used to handle hierarchical or recursive data structures. Understanding when to use CTEs can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of your SQL queries.
